During this pandemic and the lockdown I have practiced everything I have learned during the Apple Developper Academy by going from an idea to a real product.
So the project of building my own Booking platform that could be reusable for multiple clients has grown and I have worked on a lot of designs and UX. The almost finished project is the current version.
While still working on it as a Side project during my research for my first iOS Developper Position. I continue my researches and talkings to business owner to build a product that could fit as much as possible.

The App is working thanks to a FireBase database handling the login and the bookings database
## The experience starts with a login page

## That will redirect you:
   ## - either you are business owner, and you will be directed to your bookings. 
   ## - or you are a customer and you can sign/log in to acces your booking or the available ones.

##  To select a booking you have to confirm your date

## Once a booking is done and still to come the customer will access its ticket and see its settings

Working with dates is definitly a real progress that I have made thanks to this development! I also had to figure out an algorithm that allow me to display a spot only if there is still a seat available depending on the seats available in the owner settings which he can access and change at any time. 

I am already proud of the progress I did working on it and the notification that are also working triggered when a booking is created/cancelled and also the owner's feature to call a customer.



Those modales have been built thanks to the designer @MengTo and it's designcode.io inpiration

You can leave me comments on the design, the ux or even my code at @lucchettan on twitter!
